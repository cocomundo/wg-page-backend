authentication (jWT crate) -> like this https://gill.net.in/posts/auth-microservice-rust-actix-web1.0-diesel-complete-tutorial/
https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/session-based-authentication-in-rust/
-> after some research implement sessions via actix-web sessions (https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html)
graphQL
new types (todolist eintrÃ¤ge)

make id to u32 -> cant be negative (also in schema) -> difficult because POSTGRES has no UINT
error_handling -> consider using this error over anyhow, to specify more error details, eg. deleting user -> eror user could not be deleted
r2d2 -> for database connection pool
activate toml formatter // formatter on safe
tls

Userstories:
shopping_item is deleted (bought) by user -> move it in bought_item_list and mark user who deleted item as buyer
--> would require a price, so frontend would have to ask for price when items gets deleted maybe ?
